# Google-Gen-Ai--Hack

AI Teaching Assistant for Data Structures and Algorithms
This AI-powered application is designed to teach Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using the Socratic method, focusing on sorting algorithms. The application is built using Streamlit, Google Gemini API, and several other libraries, making learning engaging through both text-based conversations and visual explanations of sorting algorithms.

Features
Socratic Method Chat Interface:

The AI assistant helps students learn DSA through questions, encouraging self-discovery without giving direct answers.
Current focus: Sorting Algorithms (Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort).
Voice and Text Input:

Users can interact with the assistant by typing or speaking using the microphone, with speech-to-text functionality.
Chat History:

Chats can be saved, loaded, and reviewed, allowing users to track their learning progress.
Visualization and Learning Resources:

Provides videos and images of sorting algorithm visualizations.
Explanations are generated through the Google Gemini API, ensuring thorough descriptions of sorting processes.
Fully Customizable:

Easy to extend with additional sorting algorithms or topics related to Data Structures and Algorithms.
Requirements
Make sure you have the following installed before running the application:

Python 3.8 or higher
Streamlit
Google Gemini API (for generative AI)
dotenv
streamlit-mic-recorder
pytube
streamlit-player
PIL (Pillow)

Usage
1. Chat Interface
Start a new chat by entering a topic (e.g., Sorting Algorithms).
You can interact with the AI either by typing or using voice input.
Save your chats or load previous conversations from the chat history.

3. Visualization and Learning
Navigate to the Learning Resources With Summarization section.
Select a sorting algorithm to see a YouTube video and a visual image.
The AI will generate a detailed explanation of the selected algorithm.

4. Saving and Managing Chats
Save chats for future reference.
Load saved chats to review previous discussions.
Delete saved chats or the entire chat history as needed.

Contributions
Contributions to the project are welcome! You can add new algorithms, improve explanations, or enhance the user experience. Feel free to submit a pull request or open an issue.
